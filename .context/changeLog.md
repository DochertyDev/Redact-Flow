## Summary of Changes

**October 14, 2025**:

Conducted a comprehensive debugging and fixing process for the packaged Electron desktop application, resolving startup failures, UI rendering issues, and API communication problems to deliver a fully functional distributable. Here's what was changed:

### Files Modified

#### 1. **`desktop/main.js`**

- Modified the backend startup logic to listen on both `stdout` and `stderr`, ensuring the "Uvicorn running on" message is always detected.
- Corrected the path for loading `index.html` from the non-existent `web` directory to the correct `renderer` directory.

#### 2. **`desktop/package.json`**

- Chained the `build` and `dist` scripts to ensure the frontend is always built with the latest changes before the application is packaged.

#### 3. **`frontend/vite.config.ts`**

- Set the `base` option to `'./'` to force the generation of relative asset paths in `index.html`, fixing resource loading errors in the packaged app.

#### 4. **`frontend/src/services/api.ts`**

- Modified the `ApiService` to allow the `baseURL` to be set dynamically at runtime instead of using a hardcoded relative path.
- Restored the `axios` error interceptor that was accidentally removed, fixing a TypeScript build failure.

#### 5. **`frontend/src/App.tsx`**

- Implemented a `useEffect` hook to listen for the backend port sent from the main Electron process via IPC.
- Configured the `apiService` with the correct backend URL upon receiving the port.

#### 6. **`DEVELOPER.md`**

- Corrected the directory structure diagram to reflect that the frontend build is copied to the `renderer` directory.
- Updated the architecture overview to accurately describe the IPC-based communication between the frontend and backend in the packaged app.

#### 7. **`README.md`**

- Added a new "Building the Desktop Installer" section with clear instructions on how to run the build process.
- Appended a note explaining the purpose of the `.context` directory for contributors.

### Key Features Implemented

- ✅ **Robust Startup:** Fixed a race condition that caused the application to fail silently on launch.
- ✅ **UI Rendering Fix:** Resolved the "White Screen of Death" by correcting asset paths and file loading logic.
- ✅ **API Connectivity:** Enabled successful communication between the frontend and backend in the final packaged application.
- ✅ **Streamlined Build Process:** Automated the end-to-end build process with a single command, reducing the chance of human error.
- ✅ **Documentation Update:** Ensured developer and user documentation accurately reflects the project's current state and build procedures.

These changes transition the project from a non-functional build to a stable, distributable, and fully operational desktop application.

## Summary of Changes

**October 13, 2025**:

I've added functionality to copy sanitized and detokenized text directly to the clipboard, providing a convenient alternative to downloading files. Here's what was changed:

### Files Modified

#### 1. **`frontend/src/components/Download/DownloadPanel.tsx`**

- Added a new "Copy Content" button next to the "Download Sanitized File" button.
- The button uses a `Clipboard` icon from `lucide-react`.
- Implemented an `handleCopy` function that retrieves the `sanitizedText` from the Zustand store and uses the browser's Clipboard API to copy it.
- Added a visual feedback mechanism (e.g., changing button text to "Copied!" for a few seconds) to confirm the action was successful.

#### 2. **`frontend/src/components/Detokenize/DetokenizationView.tsx`**

- Added a "Copy Content" button to the "Detokenized Document Preview" card.
- This button copies the `detokenizedText` from the Zustand store to the clipboard.
- Reused the same `handleCopy` logic and visual feedback pattern for consistency.

#### 3. **`frontend/src/components/Review/ReviewPanel.tsx`**

- Added a "Copy Content" button to the "Sanitized Document" panel to allow copying before the final download step.

### Key Features Implemented

- ✅ **Copy Sanitized Text**: Users can now copy the tokenized output directly from the review/download step.
- ✅ **Copy Detokenized Text**: Users can copy the final, detokenized text after processing.
- ✅ **Clipboard API Integration**: Uses the modern and secure `navigator.clipboard.writeText` API.
- ✅ **User Feedback**: Provides clear visual confirmation when text has been successfully copied.

This enhancement streamlines the user workflow, especially for those who intend to paste the content directly into an LLM or another application.

## Summary of Changes

**October 12, 2025**:

I've implemented changes to the vertical sizing and layout of components on the "Detokenize & Download" screen, ensuring a fixed height with scrollbars for text content and restoring the side-by-side layout.

### Files Modified

#### 1. **`frontend/src/components/Detokenize/DetokenizationView.tsx`**

- **Vertical Sizing for Text Areas:**
  - Removed `flex-grow` from the `div` elements displaying LLM output and detokenized text.
  - Changed `min-h-48` to a fixed `h-48` for these `div`s, ensuring a consistent vertical length and enabling scrollbars for overflowing content.
  - Changed the `textarea` for pasted content from `min-h-36` to a fixed `h-36`.
- **Parent Container Sizing:**
  - Updated both `Card` components to have a `min-h-[450px]` to accommodate the new fixed heights of their children and maintain visual balance.
- **Layout Restoration:**
  - Re-introduced the `div` with `className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6 px-6"` as the direct parent of the two `Card` components. This resolved a regression that caused the components to stack vertically instead of appearing side-by-side.

### Key Features & Fixes

- ✅ **Controlled Vertical Sizing:** Text components now have a defined vertical length, preventing them from expanding indefinitely.
- ✅ **Scrollbars for Overflow:** Content exceeding the defined height now triggers scrollbars, improving UI consistency.
- ✅ **Restored Side-by-Side Layout:** The two main content panels on the "Detokenize & Download" screen are correctly displayed side-by-side again.
- ✅ **Improved Visual Balance:** The `min-h` on the `Card` components helps maintain a balanced layout.

**October 12, 2025**:

I've implemented a file size limit for uploads and resolved several maintenance issues. Here’s a summary of the changes:

### Files Modified & Created

#### 1. **`frontend/src/constants.ts`** (New File)

- Created a new constants file to store shared values.
- Added `MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES` and set it to `5242880` (5 MB).

#### 2. **`frontend/src/components/Upload/FileUpload.tsx`**

- Implemented a **5 MB file size limit** using the `maxSize` property in the `useDropzone` hook.
- Updated the `onDrop` callback to handle `fileRejections`, displaying the error message "File exceeds the 5 MB size limit." when an oversized file is uploaded.

#### 3. **`frontend/src/components/Detokenize/DetokenizationView.tsx`**

- Applied the **same 5 MB file size limit** and error handling logic as in `FileUpload.tsx` for consistency.

#### 4. **`frontend/src/components/Sanitize/TokenHighlight.tsx`**

- Refactored the `onClick` handler to resolve a linting error regarding an unused variable.

#### 5. **`frontend/src/components/common/ManualTokenizationPopup.tsx`**

- Removed unused state variables (`error` and `setError`) to fix linting errors.

#### 6. **`frontend/src/App.tsx`**

- Resolved a TypeScript build error (`Cannot find namespace 'JSX'`) by changing the type of the `description` property in the `stepContent` object from `JSX.Element` to `React.ReactNode`.

### Key Features & Fixes

- ✅ **5 MB File Size Limit**: Prevents users from uploading excessively large files in both the sanitization and detokenization steps.
- ✅ **Consistent Error Handling**: Provides clear and consistent error messages for oversized files across the application.
- ✅ **Code Maintenance**: Fixed all outstanding linting errors, improving code quality.
- ✅ **Build Stability**: Resolved a critical TypeScript error, ensuring the frontend application builds successfully.

The application is now more robust with the added file size validation and the codebase is cleaner and more stable.

## Summary of Changes

**October 12, 2025**:

**File Modified:** `DetokenizationView.tsx`

**Change Made:** Updated the className on line 222 from `h-96` (384px) to `h-64` (256px) for the detokenized document preview text area.

This change ensures both text areas (LLM Output on the left and Detokenized Document Preview on the right) now have the same vertical height of `h-64`, eliminating the gap you highlighted in the image. Both components will now have equal padding from the bottom of their parent Card components.

The change follows best practices by:

- Using consistent Tailwind utility classes
- Maintaining the existing styling patterns in your codebase
- Ensuring visual symmetry between the two panels

I've successfully updated both components to use a toggle button approach. Here's a summary of the changes:

### Files Modified

#### 1. **FileUpload.tsx** (Initial Upload Screen)

- **Added toggle button** at the top center to switch between "Upload File" and "Paste Text" modes
- **Default mode**: File Upload (centered, main component)
- **Toggle button labels**:
  - When in Upload mode: "Switch to Paste Text" with Type icon
  - When in Paste mode: "Switch to File Upload" with Upload icon
- **Layout**: Single centered component (max-w-2xl) instead of side-by-side
- **Paste textarea**: Larger height (300px) when in paste mode for better user experience

#### 2. **DetokenizationView.tsx** (LLM Output Screen)

- **Same toggle pattern** applied for consistency
- **Toggle button** positioned at the top center of the LLM Output card
- **Same button labels and icons** as FileUpload
- **Paste textarea**: 150px height (appropriate for the card layout)
- **Maintained** all existing functionality (file upload, paste text, character limits, clear buttons)

#### 3. **Key Features**

- ✅ Toggle button switches between upload and paste modes
- ✅ Only one input method visible at a time
- ✅ File upload is the default view
- ✅ Clear visual indication of current mode
- ✅ All previous functionality preserved (character limits, validation, mutual exclusivity)
- ✅ Consistent UX across both upload screens
- ✅ Error handling maintained

The interface is now cleaner with a single focused input method at a time, making it less overwhelming for users while maintaining all the flexibility of both upload and paste options.
