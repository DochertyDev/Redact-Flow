### 1. Understanding the Goal

The primary objective is to successfully push the local `Redact-Flow` project repository to a new, currently empty remote repository on GitHub. This must be achieved by resolving the "file size limit exceeded" error caused by large files in the commit history, while considering the user's preference for preserving said history.

### 2. Investigation & Analysis

Before executing any strategy, a clear understanding of the repository's state is crucial. The errors indicate large files exist within the `backend/venv` and `desktop/backend` directories in the commit history. The following steps are necessary to gather full context:

* **Analyze Commit History:** The most critical unknown is which commits introduced the large files. Answering this will determine the scope of any history modification.
  * **Action:** Run `git log --stat --oneline` in the terminal. This will provide a compact view of the entire commit history, showing which files were changed in each commit. This information is key to the "Historical Edit" strategy.
* **Review All Ignore Files:** While the root `.gitignore` was inspected, other `.gitignore` files could exist within subdirectories, or the existing rules might be insufficient.
  * **Action:** Use the `glob` tool with the pattern `**/.gitignore` to find all `.gitignore` files in the project.
  * **Action:** Use the `read_file` tool on all discovered `.gitignore` files to understand all current ignore rules and confirm they correctly target all necessary build artifacts and dependency directories (`node_modules`, `venv`, `dist`, `build`, etc.).

### 3. Proposed Strategic Approach

There are two viable strategies to solve this problem. They differ in complexity, time required, and their impact on your local commit history.

---

#### **Option A: The "Fresh Start" Strategy (Recommended for Simplicity)**

This approach resolves the issue by creating a single, clean initial commit that contains all your source code but excludes the problematic large files. It is fast and avoids complex Git operations.

* **Core Idea:** Erase the tainted local history and replace it with one perfect commit.
* **Pros:** Simple, fast, and has a very low risk of error.
* **Cons:** **This will erase your detailed local commit history.** All your changes will be grouped into a single "Initial commit".
* **Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes.

**Phases & Instructions:**

1. **Phase 1: Backup Your Current Work (Safety Step)**
    * **Instruction:** Run `git branch backup-main`. This creates a backup of your current branch, just in case.
2. **Phase 2: Reset The Branch History**
    * **Instruction:** Run `git update-ref -d HEAD`. This command resets your `main` branch, effectively making it an "unborn branch". All your files will be preserved on your disk but will now be treated by Git as new, uncommitted files.
3. **Phase 3: Create a Clean Commit**
    * **Instruction 1:** Run `git add .` to stage all your files. Git will now correctly apply the `.gitignore` rules, excluding `backend/venv`, `desktop/backend`, and other ignored paths.
    * **Instruction 2:** Run `git commit -m "Initial commit"` to create the single, clean commit.
4. **Phase 4: Push to GitHub**
    * **Instruction:** Run `git push -u origin main`. This push will now only contain the single clean commit and should succeed.

---

#### **Option B: The "Historical Edit" Strategy (Preserves History)**

This approach, which you requested, uses an advanced Git tool to walk through your commit history and surgically remove the large files from the specific commits that created them.

* **Core Idea:** Rewrite the local commit history to correct past mistakes.
* **Pros:** **Preserves your commit messages and history.**
* **Cons:** More complex, takes longer, and carries a higher risk of user error during the rebase process.
* **Estimated Time:** 15-30 minutes (depending on the number of commits).

**Phases & Instructions:**

1. **Phase 1: Begin the Interactive Rebase**
    * **Instruction:** Run `git rebase -i --root`. This will open a text editor in your terminal listing every commit in your repository.
2. **Phase 2: Mark Commits for Editing**
    * **Instruction:** In the text editor, review the list of commits. For each commit that you believe introduced large files (based on your `git log` investigation), change the word `pick` at the beginning of its line to `edit`. Once done, save the file and close the editor.
3. **Phase 3: Edit the History**
    * **Instruction:** Git will now stop at the first commit you marked with `edit`. You must perform the following commands:
        1. `git rm -r --cached backend/venv` (to remove the venv directory)
        2. `git rm -r --cached desktop/backend` (to remove the desktop build artifacts)
        3. `git commit --amend --no-edit` (to save the changes to this commit)
        4. `git rebase --continue` (to proceed to the next marked commit)
    * **Repeat** these four commands for every commit you marked with `edit`.
4. **Phase 4: Push to GitHub**
    * **Instruction:** Once the rebase is complete and your terminal returns to normal, run `git push -u origin main`. The push contains your rewritten history and should now succeed.

### 4. Verification Strategy

Success for either strategy is measured by a single, unambiguous outcome:

* **Primary Verification:** A successful execution of `git push -u origin main` without the `remote rejected` error.
* **Secondary Verification:** After a successful push, navigate to your repository on `github.com`. Browse the code to confirm that the `backend/venv` and `desktop/backend` directories are not present.

### 5. Anticipated Challenges & Considerations

* **Decision Point:** The primary consideration is the value of your local commit history. If the detailed history is not critical, **Option A is strongly recommended** for its simplicity and speed.
* **Execution Risk (Option B):** The "Historical Edit" strategy is powerful but unforgiving. Mistakes made while editing the rebase file or during the rebase steps can corrupt your local branch. The `backup-main` branch created in Option A's first step would be a wise safety measure to take even if you choose Option B.
* **Tool Familiarity:** Option B requires comfort with a command-line text editor (like Vim or Nano), which will be opened automatically by Git.
